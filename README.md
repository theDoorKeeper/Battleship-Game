This Battleship project felt challenging at first , as it was the first project i made with TDD in mind , so i had to make all the logic work and make sense ony using Jest
testing , and it felt hard to grasp at first , but moving on piece by piece testing feature by feature it got clearer after each test , but this process allowed me to easily
implent DOM without having too many issues , the hardest part really was the features i forgot to test (like the one making the ships not split up into different rows 
if they were too big for their rows ) , but it was rewarding to be able to make this game without using a framework , and primarly using TDD and OOP concepts to guide me 
through it .

## Features-to-add:

- Smarter AI ( this one ony shoots randomly ) ;
- Effect that highlights the squares that the ship is going to occupy when you hover over your board ;
- Sound effects for , shooting , missing , and sunking ships ;
